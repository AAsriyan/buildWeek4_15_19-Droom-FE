### What is Droom?

Droom allows job seekers and employers to match with each other in order to provide a seamless hiring process. Think Tinder + LinkedIn.

### What does Droom do?

Droom allows users to create a detailed profile that will be inserted into either the job seeker pool or the employer pool. Others users will be be able to go through a list of recommended jobs or applicants and pick the ones that they want. If a job seeker and an employer both pick each other, they will show up in their matches.

### Technologies Used

The front-end of Droom was built using React and Redux.

### Project Goal

The goal of this project was to deliver an MVP version of Droom in 4 days. While not a fully completed project, Droom is currently in a stage that is usable - making for an adequate MVP.

### Project Stage

This project is still in an early stage. While the base functionality works, the app still needs both bug resolving and style polishing.

### Known Issues

Most bugs are minor, but there is one fairly large bug that forces the user to refresh the page in order to get data rendering in one or two cases.
